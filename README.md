# invert-case
 A utility to add a keyboard shortcut that inverts the case of whatever you have selected  

## Usage
To use, simply run the application. While it's running, highlight any text and press CTRL + Caps Lock. Any text you have highlighted will have the capitalisaiton inverted (all capital letters become lowercase and all lowercase letters become capital.)

eg. `This is a Test` becomes `tHIS IS A tEST`

The application can be closed from the system tray.

## Build instructions
To build (or just use without having another executable lying around), download and install [Autohotkey](https://www.autohotkey.com).  
Afterwards, you can run `CaseInvert.ahk` to run the script without compiling, or compile it yourself.
