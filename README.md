# invert-case
 A utility to add a keyboard shortcut that inverts the case of whatever you have selected  
 [Releases page](https://github.com/Jono997/invert-case/releases)

## Usage
To use, simply run the application. While it's running, highlight any text and press CTRL + Caps Lock. Any text you have highlighted will have the capitalisaiton inverted (all capital letters become lowercase and all lowercase letters become capital.)

eg. `This is a Test` becomes `tHIS IS A tEST`

The application can be closed from the system tray.

## Build instructions
To build (or just use without having another executable lying around), download and install [Autohotkey](https://www.autohotkey.com).  
Afterwards, you can run `CaseInvert.ahk` to run the script without compiling, or compile it yourself.

## Future plans
I don't really intend to keep maintaining this outside of bugfixes. It's a very simple program (if I dare call it that) that either does its job well enough to be left alone or doesn't. That being said, I do intend to port it to Autohotkey 2.0 eventually, but I have no concrete plans as to when. Maybe I'll also look into ways to "port" (more than likely completely rewrite) it to MacOS and Linux, but those are even more unlikely.

TL;DR: If it isn't broken, I'm probably not going to do anything.
